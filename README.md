# RunJavaScriptOnKeyPress (Overhaul)
<p>This is the new version of RunJavaScriptOnKeyPress, if you want the original version go <a href="https://github.com/SoaringGecko/RunJavaScriptOnKeyPress-Old_Version-">here</a></p>

## The Generator
<p>It is a web based generator (I have tested it on Firefox and Edge, I don't use chrome)</p>
<p>You can use it <a href="https://soaringgecko.github.io/RunJavaScriptOnKeyPress/">here</a></p>

## Why ReadME So Bad?
<p>I haven't had the time to fix it yet</p>

## Why Did You Waste Your Time Making This?
<p>When I made the <a href="https://soaringgecko.github.io/RunJavaScriptOnKeyPress/">original version</a> I was messing around with triggering JS on keypress a lot and got tired of having to look up the key IDs every time. I remade it because I remember having a lot of fun programming the original and it was well... kinda bad so I decided why not fix it?</p>
